 [Addon] Item Panel & Batch Naming [0.8.4]

    Version: 0.8.4

    Features, at a glance:

    Item Panel
    → Activate batch naming
    → Display & edit all currently selected objects and any related object data, bones, constraints, bone constraints & modifiers.

    Batch Naming
    → Perform batch naming on objects, constraints, modifiers, object data, bones & bone constraints within your selection.
    → Control which type of objects, constraints, bone constraints & modifiers will be renamed.
    → Find specific characters in the names and remove or replace them (python RE's supported).
    → Prefix or suffix the names.
    → Trim start and end of names.

    This add-on was built for those of us that deal with blend files that often have several objects, often numbering in the hundreds or thousands, it allows fast access to the names of objects, object data, bones, modifiers & constraints, bone or otherwise, of not only the active object but all the objects within your current selection, What is displayed within the panel can also be adjusted via toggle buttons that can have their visibility toggled as well, these options can be accessed by enabling them via the panels header check box. there is also the ability to batch rename all these items, with several options to narrow down how these names are effected & which items are to be effected, batch renaming is performed by clicking the little car icon located within the item panel, clicking this brings up a dialogue containing the batch renaming options.
